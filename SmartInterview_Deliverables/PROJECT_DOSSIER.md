# SmartInterview: Project Dossier

## A. PROJECT IDENTITY
- **Project Title:** SmartInterview
- **Alternative Names:** AI-Powered Adaptive Mock Interview Platform
- **Description:** SmartInterview is an advanced, full-stack application designed to simulate open-ended, technical mock interviews. It uses an adaptive learning engine based on Bloom’s Taxonomy to dynamically adjust question difficulty and cognitive level based on real-time candidate performance. It features a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) vector knowledge base to prevent LLM hallucinations, and a multi-signal answer evaluation system.
- **Project Type/Domain:** AI-Powered EdTech / Technical Mock Interview Platform / Web App
- **Programming Languages Used:** 
  - Approximate breakdown by file count: Python (87 files), JavaScript/JSX/TypeScript (20 files), HTML/CSS (52 files), SQL (7 files). Thus, primarily a Python/React stack.
- **Date Range of Development:** September 16, 2026 to September 21, 2026.
- **Number of Contributors:** 1 identified in git logs (`kmit20ab`).

## B. PROBLEM AND MOTIVATION
- **Problem:** Technical interview preparation relies on static, non-adaptive problem repositories (which fail to adjust to cognitive depth) or resource-intensive human mock interviews (which lack scalability). Unconstrained LLM bots frequently hallucinate and lack pedagogical structure.
- **Target Users:** Software engineering candidates transitioning from academic study to professional industry roles, and university students.
- **Objectives:** Implement deterministic PDF parsing for Resume & JD extraction, Domain-Filtered Vector Grounding, Cognitive Taxonomy Question Generation, Multi-Factor Answer Scoring, Deterministic Adaptive State Machine, and an Academic Syllabus Mode.
- **Related Work Referenced:** Static Platforms (LeetCode, HackerRank, GeeksforGeeks), Human Mock Platforms (Pramp, Interviewing.io), Generic AI Chatbots (ChatGPT, Claude).

## C. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
- **High-Level Architecture:**
  - **Frontend:** React 18 / Vite UI for candidate interaction, resume/JD upload, and performance dashboards.
  - **FastAPI Backend:** Handles business logic and coordinates services. Contains Routers (`auth`, `resumes`, `job_descriptions`, `interviews`, `users`).
  - **Auth Service:** Stateless JWT (HS256) and bcrypt hashing.
  - **Resume & JD Service:** Uses PyMuPDF to extract text, detects section boundaries via regex, and maps canonical skills.
  - **Vector Database (ChromaDB):** Stores domain-filtered computer science chunks (`technical_kb`) for RAG.
  - **Evaluation Service:** Uses Groq Cloud LLM and SentenceTransformers to calculate a 5-factor evaluation score.
  - **Adaptive Engine:** Python-based state machine that governs Bloom’s Taxonomy progression based on scores.
  - **Database (MySQL 8):** Persists stateless sessions, evaluations, and user metadata.
- **Data Flow:** 
  User uploads Resume & JD -> Backend extracts skills -> Skills mapped (Group A / Group B) -> Candidate starts interview -> System selects skill -> ChromaDB queries related text chunks via SBERT -> Prompt sent to Groq LLM -> Question presented to User -> User submits answer -> Evaluated across 5 dimensions (LLM + SBERT + coverage) -> Score updates AdaptiveState (Bloom level and difficulty adjust) -> Next question.

## E. DATA
- **Dataset Name:** `technical_kb` (Curated Computer Science Knowledge Base)
- **Source/License:** Internally curated, stored in `data/processed/`.
- **Number of Samples:** 402 chunks, 50 concepts, 8 domains (`cn`, `dbms`, `design-patterns`, `dsa`, `ml-dl`, `oop`, `os`, `system-design`).
- **File Formats:** SQLite/Parquet (within ChromaDB).
- **Preprocessing Steps:** Token count bounded between 50 and 400 tokens (average 195.47). Globally unique ID assigned to each chunk (`<domain>_<concept>_<index:03d>`).

## F. METHODOLOGY / IMPLEMENTATION
- **Algorithms / Techniques:**
  - **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Uses `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384 dimensions) for top-3 semantic retrieval via ChromaDB, filtered by specific technical domains.
  - **Bloom’s Taxonomy State Machine:** Python logic strictly manages progression (Score >= 80 -> advance Bloom level; Score < 50 -> regress Bloom level) independently of LLM.
  - **Multi-Factor Scoring Engine:** Overall Score = 0.30(Technical) + 0.20(Completeness) + 0.20(Relevance) + 0.15(Semantic Similarity via SBERT) + 0.15(Concept Coverage).
  - **Skill Mapping Priority:** Group A (JD ∩ Resume) tested first, Group B (JD - Resume) tested next.
- **Model Details:** Groq Cloud `openai/gpt-oss-120b` for generative tasks (temperature 0.7 for questions, 0.3 for evaluation).
- **Important Code Snippets:**

**1. Scoring Formula Weights (`backend/app/services/evaluation_service.py`)**
```python
# ── Scoring Weights (documented) ─────────────────────────────
WEIGHT_TECHNICAL = 0.30
WEIGHT_COMPLETENESS = 0.20
WEIGHT_RELEVANCE = 0.20
WEIGHT_SEMANTIC_SIMILARITY = 0.15
WEIGHT_CONCEPT_COVERAGE = 0.15
```
*Explanation: Defines the exact constant multipliers used to calculate a candidate's overall answer score out of 100, combining AI critique with deterministic semantic and coverage checks.*

**2. Adaptive Progression Thresholds (`backend/app/services/adaptive_engine.py`)**
```python
# Adaptive score thresholds
ADVANCE_THRESHOLD = 80   # Score >= 80 → progress
MAINTAIN_LOWER = 50      # Score 50-79 → maintain
# Score < 50 → regress/reinforce
```
*Explanation: Defines the strict deterministic cutoffs for adjusting question difficulty and cognitive Bloom level based on the evaluation score.*

**3. Bloom Taxonomy Question Types (`backend/app/services/adaptive_engine.py`)**
```python
BLOOM_QUESTION_TYPES = {
    "remember":    ["conceptual", "practical", "technical_reasoning"],
    "understand":  ["conceptual", "technical_reasoning", "practical"],
    "apply":       ["practical", "conceptual", "scenario"],
    "analyze":     ["technical_reasoning", "practical", "scenario"],
    "evaluate":    ["scenario", "technical_reasoning", "project"],
    "create":      ["project", "scenario", "practical"],
}
```
*Explanation: Maps cognitive Bloom levels (Remember to Create) to the specific types of questions the LLM will be instructed to generate.*

**4. JD Skill Grouping Strategy (`backend/app/services/jd_service.py`)**
```python
# Skill mapping priority:
# Priority 1 (Group A): JD skills that ARE in Resume  → verify claimed experience
# Priority 2 (Group B): JD skills NOT in Resume       → test role requirement/gap
# Resume-only skills   → NOT included in default interview plan
```
*Explanation: The comment clearly outlines the filtering algorithm that determines which skills are tested in an interview session, prioritizing actual overlap with job requirements.*

**5. Safe LLM Initialization (`backend/app/services/question_service.py`)**
```python
except SystemExit:
    # get_groq_model calls sys.exit(1) on failure — catch it
    # Fall back to configured model
    _groq_model = os.getenv("GROQ_MODEL", "openai/gpt-oss-120b")
    print(f"[QuestionService] WARNING: Model verification failed, using fallback: {_groq_model}")
```
*Explanation: Provides fault-tolerance during LLM initialization, catching system exits and ensuring a graceful fallback to a default Groq model (`gpt-oss-120b`).*

## G. RESULTS AND EVALUATION

## I. LIMITATIONS AND ISSUES
- **Known Bugs/Security Limitations:** Academic implementation stores JWT tokens in browser `localStorage` (vulnerable to XSS). It lacks refresh token rotation, multi-tab user isolation, and CSRF protection.
- **OBSERVATION:** No robust unit testing suite (pytest, jest) was found in the repository during inspection.
- **OBSERVATION:** Voice Service (Whisper STT) evaluation is deferred to a future "Week 11" as noted in code comments.

## J. FUTURE SCOPE
- **Production Enhancements:** Shift JWT storage to `HttpOnly` secure cookies, implement rate limiting, and deploy Redis for token rotation.
- **Full Voice Integration:** Complete integration of Groq Whisper STT into the evaluation pipeline.
